As any software in the ProSoft Suite, EasySave will be integrated into the pricing policy.

- Price per unit: 200 €tax excl.

- Annual maintenance contract 5/7 8-17h (updates included): 12% purchase price (Annual contract with tacit renewal with revaluation based on the SYNTEC index) 

During this project, our team will be responsible of the development, management of major and minor versions, but also documentation for users,
for Customer Support: Information required for Technical Support. To ensure that our work can be taken over by other teams, we must work within certain constraints such as the tools used.

## Features
- EasySave version 3.0 is a desktop client application using WPF and .Net Core.
-	Parallel backup
-	Priority file management: Priority files are files whose extensions are declared by the user in a predefined list.
-	Prohibition to simultaneously transfer files of more n KB so as not to saturate the bandwidth.
-	Real-time interaction with each or all backup works. The user can Pause, Play or Stop each backup job.
-	Temporary pause if the operation of a business software is detected.
-	Remote console: To make it possible to follow in real time the progress of backups on a remote computer, we have developed an interface allowing a user to follow on a remote computer the progress of backup work but also to act on them.
-	Our application is  Single Instance. The application cannot be launched more than once on the same computer.
-	Reduction of parallel jobs if networkload, if the network load is above a threshold, the application will reduce the tasks in parallel so as not to saturate the network.
